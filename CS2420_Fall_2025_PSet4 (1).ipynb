Check your `.ipynb` file using this [tool](https://htmtopdf.herokuapp.com/ipynbviewer/) before submitting to ensure that you completed all *Code Cells* (including detailed comments).\n",

We strongly recommend you test each of these parts before training the large models as to not waste time training models with buggy implementations. For example, you should ensure that your sampling is being done correctly, otherwise the model will still train, but your results will not be correct. For a number of sections, we have provided checks you can run to ensure correctness prior to training a large model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Federated Learning (FL) distributes the task of training a deep neural network (such as our CNN `ConvNet`) across multiple client devices. Each client may have private data they do not want to share with a central server. Therefore, instead of transmitting data, clients perform training locally and send the updated model parameters (e.g., convolutional weights) to the server. The server averages these parameters across multiple clients to update the centralized model. Finally, after the centralized model has been updated, the server sends the new version of the model to all clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure below depicts this Federated Learning paradigm (taken from [Towards Federated Learning at Scale: System Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01046.pdf)). At the beginning of a training round in the selection phase, a percentage of devices (i.e., clients) agree to participate. By agreeing to participate, a client agrees to perform local training with its own dataset that resides on the device. During the configuration phase, the up-to-date centralized model is sent to the participating clients, which then perform local training. In the reporting phase, each client sends their own updated model (trained using local data) to the server for aggregation. Note that, in the figure, one of the clients fails to report back to the central server (either due to device or network failure). To simplify this assignment, we will assume this type of device/network failure is not possible.\n",

        "In this assignment, we will simulate this distributed Federated Learning environment on a single machine (i.e., a Colab instance). Each `device` will own a subset (or partition) of the dataset (e.g., 10% of the CIFAR-10 training set) and use it to train a local version of the model. The main difference between this simulated environment and a real system is the lack of networking between devices.\n",

        "You will use the `DatasetSplit` class in *Code Cell 1.2* to create subsets of the full training dataset. The `create_device` function creates a unique instance of `ConvNet`, an instance of the `DatasetSplit` dataloader, and an optimizer and scheduler for training. This function will be called multiple times (once per device) to create all the required device instances used for Federated Learning. The `train` and `test` functions are a modified version from Assignment 2 that take a device argument (the output from `create_device`. The batch size during training is set to 128 throughout the assignment. This is passed into the `create_device` function as a default parameter value (i.e., `batch_size=128`)."

        "-----\n",
        "Quantization refers to the process of reducing the number of bits used to represent a number. In the context of deep learning, the predominant numerical format used in research and deployment has been 32-bit floating-point ([IEEE 754 Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format)).\n",
        "However, the desire for reduced model size and computation has led to research on using fewer bits to represent numbers in deep learning models.\n",
        "This can impact several aspects of the pipeline, including computation, communication, and storage requirements.\n",
        "For example, in the context of federated learning, quantizing a client model from full (32-bit) precision to 8-bit precision will reduce the model size by ~4×.\n",
        "Furthermore, because the model size is reduced, the communication required for uploading a client model is also reduced by ~4× as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this quantization comes with trade-offs.\n",
        "To see this, consider a full precision representation (32-bit floating point). This representation has a large dynamic range (from $-3.4\\times 10^{38}$ to $+3.4\\times10^{38}$) and high precision (about $7$ decimal digits).\n",
        "As a result, a full precision number can be seen as continuous data.\n",
        "In contrast, $n$-bit fixed-point representations are limited to $2^n$ discrete values.\n",
        "$n$-bit quantization generally refers to projecting a full precision weight to one of these $2^n$ discrete values by finding its nearest neighbor.  \n",

        "The 32-bit and 16-bit models perform almost identically, both reaching around 85–88% accuracy after about 20 rounds and stabilizing thereafter. This indicates that 16-bit quantization maintains nearly full precision performance. In contrast, the 4-bit quantized model shows a slight but consistent drop, plateauing near 83–84%, suggesting some information loss due to extreme quantization. Overall, reducing precision to 16 bits has minimal accuracy impact, while 4-bit quantization introduces a small but noticeable degradation."

        "In this part, you will explore gradient inversion attacks which may break privacy in federated learning. In federated learning, each client receives the current global weights of the network and sends weights updates (gradients) based on local data. But how secure is sharing weights gradients? The [Deep Leakage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08935.pdf) paper shows it is possible to recover data given weights gradients.\n",
        "To perform the attack, Deep Leakage first randomly generates a pair of \"dummy\" inputs and labels and then performs the usual forward and backwards computation.\n",
        "After deriving the dummy gradients from the dummy data, instead of optimizing model weights as in typical training, Deep Leakage optimizes the dummy inputs and labels to minimize the distance between dummy gradients and real gradients. You may refer to the paper for more details."

You could enable multi-prompt generation and varied resolutions (e.g., $512 \\times 1024$ or $1024 \\times 512$) by fine-tuning the model, but that adds training cost and must be repeated for each text-to-image model. In this part, you’ll achieve both at inference time: we’ll slice the latent into regions and guide each region with its own prompt during denoising, while also supporting varied output resolutions. This avoids any re-training, keeps compute to forward passes, and works directly with the pre-trained weights you already have.\n",
